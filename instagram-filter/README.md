#Build Your Instagram Filter

Did you know that you can build your own instagram filter? And not only is it quite easy, but you will also learn
a lot about functions, for loops, and arrays on your way there. 

Hey I've also built my own simple instagram filter. Check it out [here](https://github.com/StreetCodeAcademy/programming-fundamentals/tree/master/instagram-filter/my_simple_instagram_filter)!

Please go through the tutorial [here](https://github.com/StreetCodeAcademy/programming-fundamentals/blob/master/instagram-filter/Images-and-Pixels-Processing.pdf) to learn more about the specifics.

After you've completed the tutorial or feel like you've got it. Go ahead and build your own filter. I encourge you to get as creative
as you can with it!
