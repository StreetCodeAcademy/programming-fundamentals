# Community Standards

1. There are no dumb questions. we are all learners
2. Feedback is important. whether in the classroom or during breaks, you should feel comfortable giving feedback to any mentor
3. This is your class!
4. Mentors will try not to touch your keyboards. hold us accountable to that
5. When asking questions, see if people around you are able to help
6. We want to help. first, though, see if anyone else has run into the same question, since it also helps other people when they explain
7. StreetCode has a strictly no tolerance policy for any harassment. This classroom is a safe space for everyone
