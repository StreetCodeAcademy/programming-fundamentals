# Programming Fundamentals

Welcome to the Winter 2016 sesion of StreetCode Academy's Programming Fundamentals! Over the next 8 weeks, we'll be covering basic topics and concepts in progamming, from variables and logic to fancy things like object-oriented programming and recursion. If those words sound foreign right now, don't worry - you'll be a master of these concepts before you know it :)
