# Using the Starter Files and Eclipse

Hey there! If you're trying this from home, you'll have to be up and running with Eclipse to follow this tutorial. Head over to the [Eclipse Downloads page](https://eclipse.org/downloads/) and download the appropriate version for your operating system. After doing so, open up Eclipse. You should see a screen like this:

![Eclipse]

Don't be intimidated by the number of icons - there's only a few we'll be using to make our programs. Download and uncompress the "KarelControlFlow.zip" file onto your computer and then click the import button at the top of eclipse, which looks like this:

![Import]

You'll be asked to browse to where the file is you want to import. Navigate to the uncompressed folder you just downloaded, click on it, and then click open. If you expand the arrow next to the folder in Eclipse and expand the arrow next to the (default package) icon, you'll see a bunch of .java files. Double click on one of them and you should see a similar looking screen appear:

![Java File]

This is where we'll write our actual code - you can ignore all of the confusing syntax, as that'll be explaiend later. You'll see the following block in every program:

```java
public void run(){
	
}
```

Inside space between the two braces `{}` is where we will be writing our code for Karel the robot. Try writing `move();` in the block so that it looks like this:

```java
public void run(){
	move();
}
```
Then click the icon at the top that looks like a little guy running to run the program:

![Run]

Select the appropriate Java file, click "OK", and, once the Karel world has popped up, click "Start Program" and watch what happens.

Congrats! You're up and running with Karel.
