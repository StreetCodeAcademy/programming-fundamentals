# Getting Started with Processing

In this class, we're going to be using a tool called [Processing](https://processing.org/). Processing in an awesome Programming software that will allow us to use Java to create amazing projects while learning awesome things about programming. You can build all sorts of things with Processing, including games, art, cool visualizations, apps, and more! Checkout what other people have made with processing [here](http://www.openprocessing.org/)!


To start, head on over to the Processing website and download the software if it's not already on your computer by clicking [here](https://processing.org/tutorials/gettingstarted/). This page also has a tutorial on how to get started writing code, but feel free to skip that if you want - we'll get to that soon enough :)

# Now the fun part...


Let's get started making some magic happen in Processing! Head on over to [this page](https://processing.org/tutorials/) to see all sorts of great Processing tutorials to get you started. Feel free to run through these in whatever order you find best, but I'll give some suggestions for a good order if you're just starting - 

## Getting Started


I reccomend [this tutorial](https://processing.org/tutorials/overview/) to get you oriented with how Processing works and some of the cool things you can do with it. Feel free to skim - the tutorial is a bit wordy, and not all of it is 100% essential to know. One of the most important things to get out of this is how the **setup** and the **draw** functions work. Just to summarize if you didn't get it from the tutorial, the setup function runs once at the beginning of your program before anything happens, then the draw function will repeatedly run over and over as the rest of the program executes. This may seem trivial, but it's important to know in order for us to make cool things with Processing as we go on.

Once that's done, I definitely reccomend doing [this tutorial](https://processing.org/tutorials/drawing/) to learn about how to draw shapes in Processing and how the cordinate system works. Drawing shapes is one of the main things programs in Processing are build on, and it can allow you to do awesome things like make animations for games or create some cool artwork.

## Now, let's have some fun!

After this tutorial, you're free to jump around and the rest of the tutorials on the [page](https://processing.org/tutorials/). In addition, spend some time just trying your hand at making things for fun! One helpful tutorial for experimenting with making cool artwork and pictures once you've learned the basics of [shapes and coordinates](https://processing.org/tutorials/drawing/) is the one about [color](https://processing.org/tutorials/color/).

After playing around for a bit, one really important thing to learn is how objects and classes work. To read a bit about that, go to [this tutorial](https://processing.org/tutorials/objects/).

**NOTE**: Before starting this lesson, it would be good to make sure that you have a solid grasp on

1. [Logic and control statements](https://github.com/StreetCodeAcademy/programming-fundamentals/tree/master/karel-controlflow) (if, else, while, for)
2. [Variables](https://github.com/StreetCodeAcademy/programming-fundamentals/tree/master/processing-variables)
3. [Functions](https://github.com/StreetCodeAcademy/programming-fundamentals/blob/master/processing-getting-started/Processing-Functions.pdf) 

Once you've gone through the basics of building objects, play around with objects to try doing things like making more complex drawings. Try making animations and objects that can bounce of walls. Try making your own game or artwork! Check out the bouncingball file in this folder for an example of something cool you can do using objects.

## Time for some trickier stuff

After you've had a decent amount of time to play around, let's try our hand at one of the trickier, but most fun topics in Computer Science: Recursion! Head to [this page](http://natureofcode.com/book/chapter-8-fractals/) to try it out!
