### Putting it all together

Now let’s put everything that we’ve learned together!

#####1. Draw a circle

Let’s start off with a circle. Any color, size. If we wanted to change the background color, could we do that too?

#####2. Moving circle

Now let’s make the circle move. To start, let’s make the circle move in a straight line from left to right across the screen

#####3. Circle that stops at wall

Now let’s make the circle stop at the wall

#####4. Circle that bounces off the right wall

Can we now make the circle so that it reverses direction when it hits a wall? Hint: we might need another variable

#####5. Circle that also bounces off left wall

After the circle reverses direction, can we make the circle reverse direction at the left wall?

#####6. Circle that moves up and down

Congrats! We’ve made a bouncing ball. Now can we make the ball move up and down and also bounce off the top and bottom walls?

#####7. OOP

Can we now make this object oriented? Hint: we might want to make a `BouncingBall` [class](https://processing.org/tutorials/objects/)

#####8. More bouncing balls!

Can we add more bouncing balls? Hint: an [array](https://processing.org/tutorials/arrays/) might be helpful

Extensions:
- color!
- balls change speed/direction when bouncing off of walls
