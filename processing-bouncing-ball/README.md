### Putting it all together

Now let’s put everything that we’ve learned together!

#####1. Draw a circle

Let’s start off with a circle. Any color, size. If we wanted to change the background color, could we do that too?

#####2. Moving circle

Now let’s make the circle move. To start, let’s make the circle move in a straight line from left to right across the screen

#####3. Circle that stops at wall

Now let’s make the circle stop at the wall

#####4. Circle that bounces off the right wall

Can we now make the circle so that it reverses direction when it hits a wall? Hint: we might need another variable

#####5. Circle that also bounces off left wall

After the circle reverses direction, can we make the circle reverse direction at the left wall?

#####6. Circle that moves up and down

Congrats! We’ve made a bouncing ball. Now can we make the ball move up and down and also bounce off the top and bottom walls?

#####7. OOP

What if we wanted to add more balls? Let’s move onto the lesson on [objects](objects.md) to learn how we can do that with a new CS concept

#####8. More bouncing balls!

Now that we have created a `class` for the ball, let's learn how to use arrays to add more balls! https://processing.org/tutorials/arrays/

#####9. A ball that bounces randomly off the walls

Let's learn about [inheritance](inheritance.md) to see how we can add a ball that bounces randomly off the walls

Extensions:
- colors!
