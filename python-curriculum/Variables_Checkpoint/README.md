## Variable Checkpoint Exercises

In this lesson, we'll really test our metal with variables and really make sure that we understand how to use them. While the lesson might seem repetitive and even boring, it's very important that you complete this lesson earnestly because variables are one of the underpinnings of coding and they should come to you as second nature. Imagine, we are learning to play the piano and we are solidifying our fundamentals. 

### Exercise 1: Commenting & Variable Assignment
Copy the code from the following code into IDLE window. 
Add a comment above each line of code that explains exactly what that line does and what each variable will be. If you don't know what a comment is, ask your instructor to help you. 

By the end, see if you can tell what the code will print out before you run it.

```
cars = 100
space_in_a_car = 4.0
drivers = 30
passengers = 90
cars_not_driven = cars - drivers
cars_driven = drivers
carpool_capacity = cars_driven * space_in_a_car
average_passengers_per_car = passengers / cars_driven


print("There are", cars, "cars available.")
print("There are only", drivers, "drivers available.")
print("There will be", cars_not_driven, "empty cars today.")
print("We can transport", carpool_capacity, "people today.")
print("We have", passengers, "to carpool today.")
print("We need to put about", average_passengers_per_car, "in each car.")
```


Make sure that your code runs before moving on. 

### Exercise 2: Debugging
```
cars = 100
space_in_a_car = 4.0
drivers = 30
passengers = 90
cars_not_driven = cars - drivers
cars_driven = drivers
carpool_capacity = cars_driven * spotted_ufos
average_passengers_per_car = passengers / cars_driven


print("There are", cars, "cars available.")
print("There are only", drivers, "drivers available.")
print("There will be", cars_not_driven, "empty cars today.")
print("We can transport", carpool_capacity, "people today.")
print("We have", passengers, "to carpool today.")
print("We need to put about", average_passengers_per_car, "in each car.")
```

Copy the above code into IDLE and run it. Notice that IDLE/Python reports an error and your code doesn't run. Why is that? When you know why, clearly explain the "why" and then fix it. **FIGURE IT OUT BY YOURSELF**

If you've completed the exercise, congratulations, you've debugged your code. Debugging is a very important skill. In fact, it's so important that a well known rule of thumb in software development is _"Writing code takes is a 1/4 of development while 3/4 is debugging"_.
