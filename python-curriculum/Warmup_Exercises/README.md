# Island of Programming Exercises: Warmup Exercises

## The Island Philosophy

Welcome to the Island of Programming Exercises. We've created a gigantic stash of coding problems for the students in Intro to Hack B that will live on this island and a few other islands. We're calling them islands for a couple of reasons.

1. Imagine you're a tourist. Often times, when you're traveling to a new part of the world, the islands aren't the final destination; however, adding a small detour in the trip to see them often adds to the experience as a whole. **What we're trying to say is that these exercises are simply here to build your programming confidence and strengthen certain new skills with extra practice. If you want to move onto projects in either raw Python or Processing Python, feel free!**
2. Tourists will often "island hop". **By no means do you have to do each exercise in the warmup island before moving to the intermediate island etc.** Do the ones that are interesting to you or that you feel will help you reinforce a tricky concept.
3. Islands are known for their ecological biodiversity. **We created these exercises to expose to you a variety of unique problems.** They may be difficult, but don't be discouraged. Seeing all of these different kinds of problems will help you become a better programmer and a better problem solver in other arenas of your life.
4. New islands are created by volcanic activity. **This collection of exercises is not the end all be all of programming exercises. There is always much more to learn and we encourage you to go search for it (with Google or in old-fashioned books).**

## Exercises

We're going to start with some CodingBat exercises. This is a great website that looks similar to Reeborg, but accepts only true Python syntax. You can write code and run code within the website, but I would encourage you to open up a file in IDLE and test things out in your own Python environment before running the test cases on the website.  

In order to test your code in your own environment, you'll want to make sure you define variable values for the function parameters and print out what your function returns to check test cases. You do not need any of those steps when you run it in CodingBat (or other similar platforms we will use) since a built-in tool will create test cases and compare your function's output against it. The [**Functions Primer**](https://github.com/StreetCodeAcademy/programming-fundamentals/tree/master/python-curriculum/Functions_Primer) should prepare you well to tackle these exercises and go over many details about functions that will be relevant beyond Intro to Hack B. Please read through that lesson before you work on any of the island of programming exercises.
