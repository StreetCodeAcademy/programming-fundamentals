#Welcome to the Reeborg Lite Reader

This reader is for students who would prefer to work through Reeborg by jumping into the exercises. Here are the must read parts, with none of the extra details. If you're interested in getting more information, check out the Reeborg Wordy Reader.

##How to get to Reeborg

Click the **Go to introduction Reeborg** button. 

##How to set up Reeborg with the correct configuration
Set the langugae click down bar to Python.

You will now be in the exercise called Alone. Each of the Reeborg worlds gives you various tasks to code up and have Reeborg perform.    
**IMPORTANT: Do not start with Alone. Use the click down bar in the top right corner to go to the Home 1 exercise to start!**.

You can now code away in the right hand area, your coding space.

###Reeborg navigation tips (extra credit reading...you can figure this out along the way if you would prefer)
* The **World Info** button in the top bar provides details on the task goal in each exercise. This will tell you what you are supposed to get Reeborg to do. Generally, the goal is to get Reeborg to travel to the house/flag, but sometimes it gets a bit more complicated. It may also provide hints about what commands to use.

* The **Reeborg's keyboard** button in the top bar provides a comprehensive list of all the commands Reeborg understands. You can use any of these commands in the right hand coding space and the program will understand them when you run it. Reeborg's world only understands this set of commands, though most coding languages will have more commands. It also provides conditions you can check for.

* The icons that look like a music player help you run the code you've writen in your coding space. When you're ready, hit play to run, fast forward and rewind to go back or ahead in the code, pause to pause the run on the line you're on, stop to end the run, and refresh to reset Reeborg at the starting point (you must reset to run the code again from the beginning).
